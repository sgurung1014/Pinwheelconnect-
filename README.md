# Pinwheelconnect 

**Pinwheelconnect** is a unified ecosystem that bridges education, healthcare, and advanced AI research into a single modular platform. It serves as the parent hub for multiple interlinked projects, each addressing a different aspect of human knowledge, reasoning, and well-being.

## Core Focus

- **Knowledge Hub** — hosts courseware (Artixnature), educational AI systems (Shikshya), reasoning engines (reasonnet.ai), and global contribution tools (ShikshyaSource).  
- **AI Innovation Platform** — develops, fine-tunes, and integrates models, datasets, and pipelines into real-world applications.  
- **Healthcare Gateway** — powers illumedicus.ai, a multimodal clinical decision support system.  
- **Modular Infrastructure** — each project can run independently while connecting through shared architecture (data pipelines, security layers, scalable compute).

## Vision

Pinwheelconnect exists to democratize access to knowledge and AI tools while ensuring scalability, cultural inclusivity, and enterprise-grade reliability. It functions both as an engineering framework and as a research initiative, enabling future-ready applications across education, healthcare, and general AI.

## Projects

- **Artixnature** — multi-disciplinary course platform with interactive science, mathematics, and philosophy content.  
- **Shikshya** — Nepali-centric large language model project for education, cultural preservation, and multilingual dialogue.  
- **ShikshyaSource** — global crowdsourcing platform for educational and cultural data contributions, enabling communities to add, verify, and share knowledge that fuels Shikshya and related projects.  
- **illumedicus.ai** — clinical decision support system built for scalable, reliable, and regulatory-compliant healthcare AI.  
- **reasonnet.ai** — logical reasoning engine designed to complement large language models with structured inference.  
- **NeuroScope / PinwheelStudio** — experimental AI projects for scientific discovery and creativity.

## Principles

- **Human-Centered AI** — tools built to empower, not replace.  
- **Cultural and Linguistic Inclusion** — grounding AI in Nepali and global contexts.  
- **Scalability and Modularity** — designed for research, startups, and enterprise deployments.  
- **Security and Trust** — strict data pipelines, governance, and compliance layers.
